# Devon Booker

Security Analyst at Arctic Wolf Networks. Building and securing Microsoft 365 + Azure environments.

Finishing my B.S. in Cybersecurity at WGU (Sep 2026). Studying for AZ-900 next.

## What I'm Building

**The Fortress** - A production-grade M365 + Azure + Linux + MySQL environment built from scratch. Hub-and-spoke VNet topology, Conditional Access policy sets, PIM configurations, Ubuntu Server hardened to CIS benchmarks, MySQL backend tracking every architectural decision. Not a sandbox - a documented, maintained environment I use to test everything I learn.

**M365 Security Assessment Engine** - PowerShell module that connects to Entra ID tenants via Graph API, collects identity security configurations, scores them against a baseline, stores findings in MySQL, and generates remediation reports via Python. Data collection, scoring logic, and report generation across three languages.

**The Watchtower** - Azure Sentinel detection lab with custom analytic rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK. Identity-focused detections (impossible travel, MFA fatigue, privilege escalation), Linux detections (SSH brute force, cron persistence), and automated response playbooks via Logic Apps.
